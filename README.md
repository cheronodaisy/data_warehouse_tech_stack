# Data Engineering: Data warehouse tech stack with MySQL/PostgreSQL, DBT, Airflow

## Business Need
The project creates a data warehouse for a city traffic department to host the vehicle trajectory data extracted by analysing footage taken by swarm drones and static roadside cameras. It uses the Extract Load Transform (ELT) framework using DBT to allow the department to perform data transformation on a need basis.

## Data 
A dataset from pNEUMA, an open large-scale dataset of naturalistic trajectories of half a million vehicles that have been collected by a swarm of drones in the congested downtown area of Athens, Greece.
